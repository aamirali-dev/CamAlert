# CamAlert: Camera Activity Monitoring and Alert System

CamAlert is a Python-based project that enables you to monitor a camera feed and receive email alerts when specific activities are detected. This project is designed to provide a simple yet effective way to enhance security and surveillance using your existing camera infrastructure.

## Features

- **Camera Monitoring**: CamAlert captures video feed from a camera source and analyzes it in real-time to detect activities.

- **Motion Detection**: The system uses motion detection algorithms to identify movements or changes in the camera's field of view.

- **Email Alerts**: When suspicious activity is detected, CamAlert sends email alerts to the designated recipient(s), providing a quick notification of potential security concerns.

## How It Works

1. **Camera Feed Input**: CamAlert takes input from a camera source, which could be a webcam, IP camera, or any other compatible camera device.

2. **Motion Detection**: The project utilizes advanced motion detection algorithms to analyze the video frames in real-time. It identifies changes and movements in the frames, indicating potential activities.

3. **Alert Generation**: Upon detecting suspicious activity, CamAlert triggers an email alert to notify you about the event.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run CamAlert:
